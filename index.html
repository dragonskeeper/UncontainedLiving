		The Declaration of Independence provides:<BR>
		All Men are created Equal<BR>
		We are endowed with unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty, and the pursuit of Happiness<BR>
		That to secure these Rights, governments are instituted among Men, deriving their "just" powers from the 
		CONsent of the governed, that whenever any "Form of Government" becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right
		of the people to alter or abolish it<BR>
		But when a long train of abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably the same "Object" evinces a design to reduce them
		under absolute Despotism, it is their Right, it is their Duty, to throw off such government<BR>
		<BR>
		<h1>Then we can apply most, if not all, Facts submitted to this current "Form of Government" in United States, which has polluted the 
		meanings of the words and terms to control, suppress, and manipulate, the "citizens and subjects".</h1>

			    Artilce I.[1] Section VIII.[8]:<BR>
		<BR>
			    The Congress shall have power to lay and collect Taxes, Duties, Imposts, and Excises To pay the Debts 
			    and provide for the common defence and general Welfare of the United States; but all Duties, Imposts,
			    and Excises shall be uniform throughout the United States:-
		<BR>
			    	To borrow Money on the credit of the United States;
		<BR>
				To regulate Commerce with foreign Nations, and among the several States, and with the Indian Tribes;
		<BR>
				To establish a uniform Rule of Naturalization, and uniform Laws on the subject of Bankruptcies 
			    	throughout the United States;
		<BR>
				To coin Money, regulate the Value thereof, and of foreign Coin, and fix the Standard of Weights and Measures;
		<BR>
			    	To provide for the Punishment of counterfeiting the Securities and current coin of the United States;
		<BR>
			    	To establish Post Offices and post Roads;
		<BR>
			    	To promote the Progress of Science and useful Arts, by securing for limited Times to Authors and Inventors the 
			    	exclusive Right to their respective Writings and Discoveries;
		<BR>
				To constitute Tribunals inferior to the Supreme Court;
		<BR>
			    	To define and punish Piracies and Felonies committed on the high Seas, and Offences against the Law of Nations;
		<BR>
			    	To declare War, grant Letters of Marque and Reprisal, and make Rules concerning Captures on Land and Water;
		<BR>
				To raise and support Armies, but no Appropriation of Money to that Use shall be for a longer Term than two Years;
		<BR>
			    	To provide and maintain a Navy;
		<BR>
			    	To make Rules for the Government and Regulation of the land and naval Forces;
		<BR>
				To provide for calling forth the Militia to execute the Laws of the Union, suppress Insurrections and repel Invasions;
		<BR>
				To provide for organizing, arming, and disciplining, the Militia, and for governing such Part of them as may be employed 
			    	in the Service of the United States, reserving to the States respectively, the Appointment of the Officers, and the 
			    	Authority of training the Militia according to the discipline prescribed by Congress;
		<BR>
			       	To exercise exclusive Legislation in all Cases whatsoever, over such District (not exceeding ten Miles square) as may, 
			    	by Cession of particular States, and the Acceptance of Congress, become the Seat of the Government of the United States, 
			    	and to exercise like Authority over all Places purchased by the Consent of the Legislature of the State in which the Same 
				shall be, for the Erection of Forts, Magazines, Arsenals, dock-Yards, and other needful Buildings; â€”And
		<BR>
				To make all Laws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying into Execution the foregoing Powers, and all other 
				Powers vested by this Constitution in the Government of the United States, or in any Department or Officer thereof.</p>
			    <BR>
			    <center><p>
				"The CONgress" shall have "Power" to lay and collect Taxes, Duties, Imposts, and Excises ONLY to:<BR> 
				    1. Pay the Debts of the United States<BR>
				    2. Provide for the common Defence of the United States<BR>
				    3. Provide for the general Walfare of the United States<BR>
				<BR>
				However, in order for "The CONgress" to have "Power" to do the remaining, ALL Duties, Imposts, and Excises SHALL be Uniform 
				throughout the United States.  
			    </p><BR>
			    <p>
				First - How is it that a total of 535 persons have such broad "Power" over 300 million+ people?<BR>
				Second - Where is a complete list of all the Duties, Imposts, and Excises, so We can "check" to make sure they are ALL Uniform?<BR>
				Third - Why has "The CONgres" not been paying the Debts, yet continue to borrow money on the credit of the United States?<BR>
				Fourth - If the federal government can "make a Thing but gold and silver tender in payment for Debts", why is there any Debts 
				    to begin with?<BR>
			    </center>
			    
			    Article VI (6):<BR>
			    All Debts contracted and Engagements entered into, before the Adoption of this Constitution, 
			    shall be as valid against the United States under this Constitution, as under the Confederation.
			    This Constitution, and the Laws of the United States which shall be made in Pursuance thereof;
			    and all Treaties made, or which shall be made, under the Authority of the United States, shall be 
			    the supreme Law of the Land; and the Judges in every State shall be bound thereby, any Thing in 
			    the Constitution or Laws of any State to the Contrary notwithstanding.<BR>
			    
			    The Senators and Representatives before mentioned, and the Members of the several State Legislatures, 
			    and all executive and judicial Officers, both of the United States and of the several States, shall be 
			    bound by Oath or Affirmation, to support this Constitution; but no religious Test shall ever be 
			    required as a Qualification to any Office or public Trust under the United States.<BR>
