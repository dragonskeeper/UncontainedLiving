		The Declaration of Independence provides:<BR>
		All Men are created Equal<BR>
		We are endowed with unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty, and the pursuit of Happiness<BR>
		That to secure these Rights, governments are instituted among Men, deriving their "just" powers from the 
		CONsent of the governed, that whenever any "Form of Government" becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right
		of the people to alter or abolish it<BR>
		But when a long train of abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably the same "Object" evinces a design to reduce them
		under absolute Despotism, it is their Right, it is their Duty, to throw off such government<BR>
		<BR>
		Then we can apply most, if not all, Facts submitted to this current "Form of Government" in America, which has polluted the 
		meanings of the words and terms to control and manipulate us, the "citizens and subjects".
